(FGF) shares surged in after-hours trading after a major securities filing revealed aggressive cryptocurrency plans. The Nasdaq-listed company closed at $36.17 on August 7, marking a 1.44% drop during the day. However, it jumped to $37.53 after-hours, rising 3.76% following its announcement. Fundamental Global Inc. (FGF) The company submitted an S-3 registration to the U.S. SEC to offer up to $5 billion in securities. The bulk of proceeds will go toward acquiring Ethereum (ETH), while the remainder will support corporate and operational needs. This marks a bold shift into digital assets by a traditionally non-crypto public firm. $5 Billion Securities Offering Sets Stage for Ethereum Strategy FGF aims to issue securities in multiple tranches, with flexibility in size, pricing, and terms as per future conditions. The filing includes a base prospectus and an at-the-market (ATM) prospectus for issuing common stock worth up to $4 billion. These offerings will be conducted under a new agreement with ThinkEquity, LLC. The company may sell shares over time or in one or more offerings, depending on market dynamics. If no shares are sold under the ATM agreement, the full $5 billion can be offered through other avenues. All sales will be compliant with U.S. SEC guidelines and depend on updated market value thresholds.

The company plans to use the majority of net proceeds from the common stock offering to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 7, 2025 The base prospectus enables FGF to offer common stock, preferred shares, debt securities, units, or warrants as needed. Each offering will be supported by a dedicated supplement detailing the specifics. The firm will determine pricing and structure at the time of each offering, based on prevailing conditions. Ethereum Emerges as Core Target of Fund Allocation FGF disclosed that most of the raised capital will fund direct Ethereum acquisitions. This move positions the company to benefit from ETH price movements and blockchain adoption trends. It may also appeal to shareholders seeking growth via digital assets. The rest of the funds will be allocated to operating costs, working capital and general business purposes. This dual approach balances innovation with day-to-day financial needs. The filing did not specify a timeline for Ethereum purchases or partnership arrangements. The SEC filing outlines flexibility in how unsold shares from one prospectus may roll into other offerings. This ensures maximum utilization of the $5 billion limit across various instruments. The inclusion of Ethereum as a significant target underscores the company‚Äôs evolving strategic direction. FGF‚Äôs Market Cap Constraints and Future Capacity The company clarified that it will abide by the SEC‚Äôs General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 regulations during the initial phases. Under this rule, it may not exceed $10.67 million in primary offerings within 12 months. This is because the aggregate market value of non-affiliate shares is below the $75 million threshold. As of August 4, FGF‚Äôs public float stood at $32 million, based on 835,881 non-affiliate shares at $38.30 each. Should this value rise above $75 million, the firm could lift the one-third limit on offerings. FGF‚Äôs Nasdaq-listed shares trade under the symbols ‚ÄúFGF‚Äù and ‚ÄúFGFPP‚Äù for its Series A preferred stock. The company warned that all offerings will be subject to risk factors highlighted in its filing.

(the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúFG Nexus‚Äù), today announced the filing of a $5 billion shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù), establishing one of the largest capital frameworks in the ETH digital asset treasury space. The filing includes an ‚Äúat the market offering‚Äù (‚ÄúATM‚Äù) prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of $4 billion shares of common stock that may be issued and sold from time to time. The shelf registration will provide FG Nexus with significant financial flexibility to execute opportunistic capital raises, positioning the Company to accelerate its mission of becoming the world's largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH). 'This $5 billion shelf filing represents a significant step in our capital raising capabilities and positions us to move with speed and scale when capital deployment opportunities arise,' said Kyle Cerminara, CEO and Chairman of FG Nexus. We believe this framework will enable us to capitalize on ETH accumulation opportunities and support our target of a 10% stake in the Ethereum Network.' The shelf registration establishes FG Nexus as one of the most well-capitalized players in the rapidly expanding digital asset treasury sector. Recent market activity has demonstrated strong institutional appetite for digital asset exposure, creating significant opportunities for companies with strategic capital deployment capabilities, like FG Nexus. 'The digital asset treasury market is experiencing unprecedented institutional adoption, and FG Nexus is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity because of our focused Ethereum strategy, combined with this substantial capital framework, creates multiple value drivers including ETH price appreciation, staking rewards, and access to the expanding ecosystem of tokenized real-world assets,' stated Maja Vujinovic, CEO of FG Nexus‚Äô Digital Assets Division. The Shelf Registration will allow the Company to offer and sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $5 billion of the Company‚Äôs securities, on a registered basis, subject to market conditions and the Company's capital needs, subject to applicable legal limitation. The registration statement has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. The securities covered by the registration may not be sold, nor may offers to buy the securities be made or accepted prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement. The terms of any such offerings under the registration statement will be established at the time the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC and the offering of securities pursuant to the effective registration statement will be subject to market conditions, and will be described in detail in a supplement to the prospectus filed with the SEC relating to such offering. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, nor will there be any sale of securities until registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC but there will not be any sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. Fundamental Global Inc. Fundamental Global Inc. (Nasdaq: FGF, FGFPP) is on the Ethereum Standard, and singularly focused on becoming the largest corporate holder of ETH in the world by an order of magnitude.

The shelf registration will provide FG Nexus with significant financial flexibility to execute opportunistic capital raises, positioning the Company to accelerate its mission of becoming the world's largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH). 'This $5 billion shelf filing represents a significant step in our capital raising capabilities and positions us to move with speed and scale when capital deployment opportunities arise,' said Kyle Cerminara, CEO and Chairman of FG Nexus.

'The digital asset treasury market is experiencing unprecedented institutional adoption, and FG Nexus is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity because of our focused Ethereum strategy, combined with this substantial capital framework, creates multiple value drivers including ETH price appreciation, staking rewards, and access to the expanding ecosystem of tokenized real-world assets,' stated Maja Vujinovic, CEO of FG Nexus‚Äô Digital Assets Division.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, nor will there be any sale of securities until registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC but there will not be any sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

The tricky part? Regulatory rules limit how much they can initially offer because of their current market cap.

(FGF) shares surged in after-hours trading after a major securities filing revealed aggressive cryptocurrency plans. The Nasdaq-listed company closed at $36.17 on August 7, marking a 1.44% drop during the day. However, it jumped to $37.53 after-hours, rising 3.76% following its announcement. Fundamental Global Inc. (FGF) The company submitted an S-3 registration to the U.S. SEC to offer up to $5 billion in securities. The bulk of proceeds will go toward acquiring Ethereum (ETH), while the remainder will support corporate and operational needs. This marks a bold shift into digital assets by a traditionally non-crypto public firm. $5 Billion Securities Offering Sets Stage for Ethereum Strategy FGF aims to issue securities in multiple tranches, with flexibility in size, pricing, and terms as per future conditions. The filing includes a base prospectus and an at-the-market (ATM) prospectus for issuing common stock worth up to $4 billion. These offerings will be conducted under a new agreement with ThinkEquity, LLC. The company may sell shares over time or in one or more offerings, depending on market dynamics. If no shares are sold under the ATM agreement, the full $5 billion can be offered through other avenues. All sales will be compliant with U.S. SEC guidelines and depend on updated market value thresholds. Nasdaq-listed Fundamental Global Inc. has filed an S-3 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to $5 billion of securities in multiple tranches. The company plans to use the majority of net proceeds from the common stock offering to‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 7, 2025 The base prospectus enables FGF to offer common stock, preferred shares, debt securities, units, or warrants as needed. Each offering will be supported by a dedicated supplement detailing the specifics. The firm will determine pricing and structure at the time of each offering, based on prevailing conditions. Ethereum Emerges as Core Target of Fund Allocation FGF disclosed that most of the raised capital will fund direct Ethereum acquisitions. This move positions the company to benefit from ETH price movements and blockchain adoption trends. It may also appeal to shareholders seeking growth via digital assets. The rest of the funds will be allocated to operating costs, working capital and general business purposes. This dual approach balances innovation with day-to-day financial needs. The filing did not specify a timeline for Ethereum purchases or partnership arrangements. The SEC filing outlines flexibility in how unsold shares from one prospectus may roll into other offerings. This ensures maximum utilization of the $5 billion limit across various instruments. The inclusion of Ethereum as a significant target underscores the company‚Äôs evolving strategic direction. FGF‚Äôs Market Cap Constraints and Future Capacity The company clarified that it will abide by the SEC‚Äôs General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3 regulations during the initial phases. Under this rule, it may not exceed $10.67 million in primary offerings within 12 months. This is because the aggregate market value of non-affiliate shares is below the $75 million threshold. As of August 4, FGF‚Äôs public float stood at $32 million, based on 835,881 non-affiliate shares at $38.30 each. Should this value rise above $75 million, the firm could lift the one-third limit on offerings. FGF‚Äôs Nasdaq-listed shares trade under the symbols ‚ÄúFGF‚Äù and ‚ÄúFGFPP‚Äù for its Series A preferred stock. The company warned that all offerings will be subject to risk factors highlighted in its filing.

The company said the program, which underwent 5,000 hours of testing, is smarter, faster and more useful than the previous model, GPT-4, and will be especially efficient at writing, coding and for use in the healthcare sector. 'I tried going back to GPT-4, and it was quite miserable,' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told reporters. OpenAI said it expects to reach 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT this week, and is talking with investors who are discussing a potential stock valuation of $500 billion, CNBC has reported. While GPT-4 can refuse to answer user questions if they are 'potentially risky,' GPT-5 has been designed to provide high-level responses within certain safety restraints so it cannot be used to cause harm, the company said. 'GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models,' said Michelle Pokrass, a trainer at OpenAI. GPT-5 marks the first time that users have access to a reasoning feature, which allows the software to 'think' or carry out what's known as an internal chain of thoughts before responding, the company said. The program comes with a usage cap for free users, who will have access to GPT-5 mini if they reach the free limit."}, {'id': '2c314aa1-e8d9-472f-94bb-c92ed59c2230', 'url': 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/openais-gpt-5-is-here/', 'date': '1 day ago', 'title': 'OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-5 is here', 'source': 'TechCrunch', 'content': 'OpenAI has launched GPT-5, a new flagship AI model that will power the company‚Äôs next generation of ChatGPT. GPT-5, which was released Thursday, is OpenAI‚Äôs first ‚Äúunified‚Äù AI model and combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series of models with the fast responses of its GPT series. The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT ‚Äî and its creator, OpenAI ‚Äî pointing to OpenAI‚Äôs broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are more like agents than chatbots. While GPT-4 enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users ‚Äî such as generating software applications, navigating a user‚Äôs calendar, or creating research briefs. With GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that‚Äôs responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to ‚Äúthink‚Äù through answers. Image Credits:OpenAI During a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is ‚Äúthe best model in the world,‚Äù and said it represented a ‚Äúsignificant step‚Äù along the company‚Äôs path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work ‚Äî that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI). ‚ÄúHaving something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,‚Äù said Altman. Starting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI‚Äôs VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company‚Äôs effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW The expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI‚Äôs most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world‚Äôs most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week ‚Äî nearly 10% of the globe‚Äôs population, according to the company. Many see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model‚Äôs reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI‚Äôs capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do. GPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition OpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas. The company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what‚Äôs become known as ‚Äúvibe coding.‚Äù On SWE-bench Verified ‚Äî a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub ‚Äî GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic‚Äôs latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored 74.5%, and Google DeepMind‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 59.6%. On Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam ‚Äî a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences ‚Äî a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That‚Äôs slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 44.4% on the test. Image Credits:OpenAI On GPQA Diamond ‚Äî a test of PhD-level science questions ‚Äî GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%. OpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company‚Äôs previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively. While AI chatbots are not medical professionals, millions of people are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results. In addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, subjective domains, such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits ‚Äúbetter taste‚Äù than other AI models on creative tasks. ‚ÄúThe vibes of this model are really good,‚Äù said Turley. GPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI‚Äôs previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations ‚Äî the tendency for AI models to make up information ‚Äî compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be getting worse in OpenAI‚Äôs latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn‚Äôt quite understand why it was happening. In responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That‚Äôs a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test. On a benchmark measuring an AI model‚Äôs agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI‚Äôs ability to navigate an airline‚Äôs website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI‚Äôs ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%. OpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to scheme against humans or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models. Alex Beutel, OpenAI‚Äôs safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that‚Äôs more ‚Äútransparent and honest in ways users can trust.‚Äù Beutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information. Upgrades for consumers and developers ChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT‚Äôs setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT‚Äôs responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way. Subscribers to ChatGPT‚Äôs $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI‚Äôs Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week. For developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI‚Äôs API in three sizes ‚Äî gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano ‚Äî which will spend more or less time ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model‚Äôs responses should be. The base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù series) and $10 per million output tokens. The launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, gpt-oss, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI‚Äôs previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding. However, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition.'}, {'id': '710d432c-8e70-4c01-b43c-da3a00dccdca', 'url': 'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-08-08/bloomberg-tech-8-8-2025-video', 'date': '2 hours ago', 'title': 'Watch OpenAI‚Äôs COO Lightcap Talks GPT-5 Launch | Bloomberg Tech 8/8/2025', 'source': 'Bloomberg.com', 'content': '[Failed to fetch full article: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-08-08/bloomberg-tech-8-8-2025-video on URL https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2025-08-08/bloomberg-tech-8-8-2025-video]'}, {'id': '219fbfe9-76cf-4a7c-96a5-ab51a52d39c1', 'url': 'https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/08/07/available-today-gpt-5-in-microsoft-365-copilot/', 'date': '1 day ago', 'title': 'Available today: GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot', 'source': 'Microsoft', 'content': 'We‚Äôre excited to announce that GPT‚Äë5‚ÄîOpenAI‚Äôs best AI system to-date‚Äîis rolling out today in Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Copilot Studio across the world.

GPT-5, which was released Thursday, is OpenAI‚Äôs first ‚Äúunified‚Äù AI model and combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series of models with the fast responses of its GPT series. The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT ‚Äî and its creator, OpenAI ‚Äî pointing to OpenAI‚Äôs broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are more like agents than chatbots. While GPT-4 enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users ‚Äî such as generating software applications, navigating a user‚Äôs calendar, or creating research briefs. With GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that‚Äôs responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to ‚Äúthink‚Äù through answers. Image Credits:OpenAI During a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is ‚Äúthe best model in the world,‚Äù and said it represented a ‚Äúsignificant step‚Äù along the company‚Äôs path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work ‚Äî that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI). ‚ÄúHaving something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,‚Äù said Altman. Starting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI‚Äôs VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company‚Äôs effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time. (Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.) ‚ÄúThis is just one of the ways that I‚Äôm excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,‚Äù said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI‚Äôs long-standing mission to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW The expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI‚Äôs most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world‚Äôs most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week ‚Äî nearly 10% of the globe‚Äôs population, according to the company. Many see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model‚Äôs reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI‚Äôs capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do. GPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition OpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas. The company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what‚Äôs become known as ‚Äúvibe coding.‚Äù On SWE-bench Verified ‚Äî a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub ‚Äî GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic‚Äôs latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored 74.5%, and Google DeepMind‚Äôs Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 59.6%. On Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam ‚Äî a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences ‚Äî a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That‚Äôs slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 44.4% on the test. Image Credits:OpenAI On GPQA Diamond ‚Äî a test of PhD-level science questions ‚Äî GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%. OpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company‚Äôs previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively. While AI chatbots are not medical professionals, millions of people are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results. In addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, subjective domains, such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits ‚Äúbetter taste‚Äù than other AI models on creative tasks. ‚ÄúThe vibes of this model are really good,‚Äù said Turley. GPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI‚Äôs previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations ‚Äî the tendency for AI models to make up information ‚Äî compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be getting worse in OpenAI‚Äôs latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn‚Äôt quite understand why it was happening. In responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That‚Äôs a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test. On a benchmark measuring an AI model‚Äôs agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI‚Äôs ability to navigate an airline‚Äôs website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI‚Äôs ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%. OpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to scheme against humans or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models. Alex Beutel, OpenAI‚Äôs safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that‚Äôs more ‚Äútransparent and honest in ways users can trust.‚Äù Beutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information. Upgrades for consumers and developers ChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT‚Äôs setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT‚Äôs responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way. Subscribers to ChatGPT‚Äôs $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI‚Äôs Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week. For developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI‚Äôs API in three sizes ‚Äî gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano ‚Äî which will spend more or less time ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model‚Äôs responses should be. The base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù series) and $10 per million output tokens. The launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, gpt-oss, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI‚Äôs previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding. However, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition.'}, {'id': '4bd57c8f-3d1a-403a-9469-4dac1b96b019', 'url': 'https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/08/07/OpenAI-releases-GPT-5/2931754622135/', 'date': '20 hours ago', 'title': 'OpenAI releases GPT-5, free to users', 'source': 'upi', 'content': "Aug. 7 (UPI) -- Open AI announced Thursday the release of GPT-5, the latest and most-advanced iteration of its artificial intelligence technology, which will be free to users.

'I tried going back to GPT-4, and it was quite miserable,' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told reporters. OpenAI said it expects to reach 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT this week, and is talking with investors who are discussing a potential stock valuation of $500 billion, CNBC has reported. While GPT-4 can refuse to answer user questions if they are 'potentially risky,' GPT-5 has been designed to provide high-level responses within certain safety restraints so it cannot be used to cause harm, the company said. 'GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models,' said Michelle Pokrass, a trainer at OpenAI. GPT-5 marks the first time that users have access to a reasoning feature, which allows the software to 'think' or carry out what's known as an internal chain of thoughts before responding, the company said.

There was no caption on the picture, which showed the world-destroying Star Wars space station rising over an Earth-like planet, but his audience understood the context. In fewer than 24 hours, OpenAI would release an AI model intended to wipe out all the rest. That model, GPT-5, launched earlier today with all the requisite fanfare. In an announcement video, Altman said that the product will serve as a ‚Äúlegitimate Ph.D.-level expert in anything‚Äîany area you need, on demand‚Äîthat can help you with whatever your goals are.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúanyone, pretty soon, will be able to do more than anyone in history could.‚Äù In more concrete terms, GPT-5 is an upgrade to the ChatGPT interface you‚Äôre likely already familiar with: a model that‚Äôs now a bit better at writing, coding, math and science problems, and the like. Of course, Altman has a penchant for hyperbole, and OpenAI‚Äîlike the rest of the AI industry‚Äîlikes to tout each new model as the best ever. But this particular release feels notable for a few reasons. First, it has been a long wait since the release of GPT-4 in March 2023, just a few months after ChatGPT‚Äôs debut in November 2022. And second, in that time, OpenAI has become a bona fide tech empire: As of this week, OpenAI now provides enterprise ChatGPT accounts to federal agencies at essentially no cost; its products are also used by nearly every Fortune 500 company; and today Altman announced that roughly 700 million people worldwide use ChatGPT every week. In terms of sheer reach, this is the company‚Äôs most consequential product announcement ever. Read: Big Tech‚Äôs AI endgame is coming into focus As OpenAI has ascended to the scale of a typical tech giant‚Äîit is reportedly in talks for a $500 billion valuation‚Äîthe firm has also started to act like its corporate rivals. To attract new users and customers (and keep existing ones from turning to other AI products), OpenAI has doubled down on institutional partnerships and polishing its product lineup. Sure, the company still pushes the limits of AI capabilities, but its products are what keep most consumers and businesses coming back for more. For instance, OpenAI has partnered with Bain & Company, Mattel, Moderna, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Harvard. It has brought on Jony Ive, the designer of the iPhone, to spearhead the creation of physical OpenAI devices. (The Atlantic and OpenAI have a corporate partnership.) GPT-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on a number of AI benchmarks, according to OpenAI‚Äôs internal tests, but it is far from a clean sweep: On a few tests, competing products such as Google Gemini, Anthropic‚Äôs Claude, and xAI‚Äôs Grok outperform, or are just barely below the level of, OpenAI‚Äôs new top model. The GPT-5 announcement video and launch page also contained a number of errors‚Äîincorrect labels, numbers and colors that made no sense, and missing entries on charts‚Äîthat made the program‚Äôs precise abilities, and the trustworthiness of OpenAI‚Äôs reporting, hard to discern (and led some observers to joke that perhaps GPT-5 itself had made, or hallucinated, the graphics). Yet that may not matter. OpenAI‚Äôs animating theme for GPT-5 is user experience, not ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù: Its new model is intuitive, fast, and efficient; adapts to human preferences and intentions; and is easy to personalize. Before it is more intelligent, GPT-5 is more usable‚Äîand more likely to attract and retain users. ‚ÄúThe important point is this,‚Äù Altman said, pinching a thumb and index finger together for emphasis: ‚ÄúWe think you will love using GPT-5 much more than any previous AI.‚Äù In some sense, OpenAI is learning from its greatest success. ChatGPT took off because it effectively redesigned an existing product: GPT-3.5, ChatGPT‚Äôs original underlying model, was months old by the time the chatbot came out, but it was relatively obscure. Placing essentially the same program within a conversational interface, however, made the model easy to use and obsess over. GPT-4 would eventually provide a new engine‚Äîsmarter and more capable‚Äîbut this was almost beside the point; to most people, the product was already firmly established as ChatGPT. And, like the original ChatGPT, GPT-5 is free, although nonpaying users have a limit on their usage of this most-advanced model‚Äîgiving everyone a small taste of OpenAI‚Äôs ecosystem to open up the possibility that they will want, and pay for, more. During the ensuing two-plus years of the AI race, OpenAI has kept up by releasing a slew of more minor models and new features. When Google released a version of Gemini that was extremely fast and cheap, OpenAI did the same; when DeepSeek launched a free and advanced model that could ‚Äúreason‚Äù through complex questions, OpenAI publicly released a still more powerful reasoning system of its own; as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Code seemed to corner the AI-coding market, OpenAI came out with the Codex tool for software engineers. The empire‚Äôs ambitions had no limits. Read: China‚Äôs DeepSeek surprise But these products were accompanied by a labyrinth of names and uses: GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini and GPT-4.1; o1-mini and o1-pro; o3 and o3-pro and o4-mini; and so on. This was a matter not only of poor branding but of poor design. Despite the numbers, for some uses o3 is better than o4. Users frequently complain that they don‚Äôt know how to select from OpenAI‚Äôs models. ‚ÄúWe are near the end of this current problem,‚Äù Altman said on OpenAI‚Äôs podcast in June. ‚ÄúI am excited to just get to GPT-5 and GPT-6, and I think that‚Äôll be easier for people to use.‚Äù Now OpenAI has arrived at GPT-5, and indeed, the model might be best understood as providing easier and frictionless use‚Äîan amalgam of all of OpenAI‚Äôs disparate, discrete advances from the previous two-plus years. GPT-5 ‚Äúeliminates this choice‚Äù among models and their specialties, Mark Chen, OpenAI‚Äôs chief research officer, said in today‚Äôs announcement, and that may be the new model‚Äôs core feature. GPT-5 modulates its approach to your query, using more or less ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù power‚Äîdoing the equivalent of selecting among the GPT-4os and o3s and o4s‚Äîdepending on what is asked of it. OpenAI is now retiring a large number of its previous major models. Alongside GPT-5, OpenAI also announced a number of other additions to the ChatGPT experience to ‚Äúmake ChatGPT more personalized,‚Äù Chen said, ‚Äúso it‚Äôs more like your AI.‚Äù These new features are customizable color schemes, personalities (‚Äúcynic,‚Äù ‚Äúrobot,‚Äù ‚Äúlistener,‚Äù ‚Äúnerd‚Äù), and access to Gmail and Google Calendar‚Äîall building on top of the recently added ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù feature, through which ChatGPT can pull information from previous chats. These add-ons have little to do with the bot‚Äôs engine‚Äîhow ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù or ‚Äúcapable‚Äù it is‚Äîbut they will make ChatGPT more individualized, more useful, and perhaps more fun. Businesses can integrate their data as well. Just as the years of photos and notes on your iPhone make switching to a Google Pixel undesirable, or years of using Google Drive make migrating to Microsoft OneDrive hard, if ChatGPT morphs from a vanilla bot into your AI or your company‚Äôs AI, leaving for Gemini or Claude becomes not just burdensome but a downgrade. At this stage of the AI boom, when every major chatbot is legitimately helpful in numerous ways, benchmarks, science, and rigor feel almost insignificant. What matters is how the chatbot feels‚Äîand, in the case of the Google integrations, that it can span your entire digital life. Before OpenAI builds artificial general intelligence‚Äîa model that can do basically any knowledge work as well as a human, and the first step, in the company‚Äôs narrative, toward overhauling the economy and curing all disease‚Äîit is aiming to build an artificial general assistant. This is a model that aims to do everything, fit for a company that wants to be everywhere.'}, {'id': 'f349e66a-0573-41e9-8437-fe68398c0af8', 'url': 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/', 'date': '3 hours ago', 'title': 'Sam Altman addresses ‚Äòbumpy‚Äô GPT-5 rollout, bringing 4o back, and the ‚Äòchart crime‚Äô', 'source': 'TechCrunch', 'content': 'During a Reddit ask-me-anything session on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and key members of the GPT-5 team were peppered with questions about the new model and requests to bring back its previous model, GPT-4o.

And Altman also promised, ‚ÄúWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.‚Äù This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.

For common or routine questions, Copilot prioritizes speed, using GPT-5‚Äôs smart, high-throughput model to craft quick, succinct responses to your straightforward questions. to craft quick, succinct responses to your straightforward questions. For complex or more open-ended questions, Copilot can now detect that the prompt requires advanced reasoning. In those cases, Copilot will use GPT-5‚Äôs deeper reasoning model, taking its time to craft a plan, gather and comprehend all relevant context, and check its work before providing a thorough response. The right model for the right job Copilot automatically selects the right model based on the context to more closely mirror how humans approach problems‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs offering quick, intuitive answers to simple problems, or taking more time to apply deeper reasoning to answer more complex ones. Say you‚Äôre a marketer considering request for proposal (RFP) responses from a few different agencies. You can ask Copilot to track down the responses and summarize each. It understands your simple request, scans your work data, and quickly comes back with the list you asked for. Let‚Äôs go a step further and ask for Copilot‚Äôs help evaluating and stack-ranking the RFP responses. Copilot recognizes this is a more complex request and routes to GPT-5‚Äôs reasoning model. With the full context of your work data like documents, emails, meetings, and chats, Copilot applies relevant, proprietary context to a highly specific process, giving you a thoughtful recommendation for selecting an agency. With GPT-5, Copilot can provide both fast, fluent responses and deep, reasoned analyses. This two-brain approach is what makes the GPT‚Äë5 era of Copilot particularly powerful.

'I tried going back to GPT-4, and it was quite miserable,' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told reporters. OpenAI said it expects to reach 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT this week, and is talking with investors who are discussing a potential stock valuation of $500 billion, CNBC has reported. While GPT-4 can refuse to answer user questions if they are 'potentially risky,' GPT-5 has been designed to provide high-level responses within certain safety restraints so it cannot be used to cause harm, the company said. 'GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models,' said Michelle Pokrass, a trainer at OpenAI.

The company said the program, which underwent 5,000 hours of testing, is smarter, faster and more useful than the previous model, GPT-4, and will be especially efficient at writing, coding and for use in the healthcare sector. 'I tried going back to GPT-4, and it was quite miserable,' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told reporters. OpenAI said it expects to reach 700 million weekly users on ChatGPT this week, and is talking with investors who are discussing a potential stock valuation of $500 billion, CNBC has reported. While GPT-4 can refuse to answer user questions if they are 'potentially risky,' GPT-5 has been designed to provide high-level responses within certain safety restraints so it cannot be used to cause harm, the company said. 'GPT-5 has been trained to recognize when a task can't be finished, avoid speculation and can explain limitations more clearly, which reduces unsupported claims compared to prior models,' said Michelle Pokrass, a trainer at OpenAI. GPT-5 marks the first time that users have access to a reasoning feature, which allows the software to 'think' or carry out what's known as an internal chain of thoughts before responding, the company said. The program comes with a usage cap for free users, who will have access to GPT-5 mini if they reach the free limit."}, {'id': '7f806b17-ac0e-484d-b849-290fc221adf6', 'url': 'https://fortune.com/2025/08/07/gpt-5-everything-new-different-hallucinations-personalities-vibecoding-agents-openai/', 'date': '1 day ago', 'title': 'Here‚Äôs everything in GPT-5 that‚Äôs new and different from OpenAI‚Äôs previous AI models', 'source': 'Fortune', 'content': 'OpenAI has released its new LLM model, GPT-5.

GPT-5 uses a ‚Äúreal-time router‚Äù that automates the process, picking the right tool for the right job so you don‚Äôt have to. Special personalities ChatGPT will now let users choose from four different preset ‚Äúpersonalities‚Äù when they interact with it: ‚Äúcynic,‚Äù ‚Äúrobot,‚Äù ‚Äúlistener,‚Äù and ‚Äúnerd.‚Äù These personalities are intended to make using the chatbot feel more natural and context-appropriate. If you want a bit more sarcasm, choose cynic, whereas if you‚Äôre using it for work, the ‚Äúefficient and blunt‚Äù robot persona might be better. Fewer hallucinations OpenAI claims that GPT-5 is less prone to ‚Äúhallucinating,‚Äù or inventing information. According to OpenAI, GPT-5 was 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT-4o in tests in which it had web search enabled and used anonymized prompts; when ‚Äúthinking,‚Äù GPT-5 was 80% less likely to contain an error than OpenAI o3. But that still doesn‚Äôt eradicate hallucinations, and, as Mashable explains, it means that GPT-5 will still hallucinate one out of every 10 times on common tasks. A better writer According to OpenAI, GPT-5 is a much better writer than its predecessors, producing more ‚Äúcompelling, resonant writing with literary depth and rhythm.‚Äù The company provided side-by-side comparisons of GPT-5‚Äôs output versus that of GPT-4o for things like wedding toasts and poems. A better coder While previous versions of GPT had software coding capabilities, OpenAI says GPT-5 brings improved ease and sophistication to its ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù functionality, allowing users to ‚Äúcreate beautiful and responsive websites, apps, and games‚Äù in a single prompt. Agentic capabilities GPT-5 integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar to assist with scheduling, reminders, email follow‚Äëups, and other productivity tasks. (This capability will be initially limited to users of the company‚Äôs paid ‚Äúpro‚Äù membership.) Health LLMs have become a popular way for people to get medical information and health advice. OpenAI says GPT-5 scores higher than any of its previous models on the HealthBench test, and that it acts more like ‚Äúan active thought partner, proactively flagging potential concerns and asking questions to give more helpful answers.‚Äù Of course, OpenAI also points out that it does not replace a medical professional. Your mileage may vary Those are just a few of the new features and improvements, which will provide plenty of opportunity for consumers and businesses to experiment with the latest model and compare it with their current go-to models. Whether it represents a major leap forward, or more of an iterative improvement will become clear in the days and weeks ahead as outside experts test the model and real-world users play around with it. Early testers interviewed by Reuters said the improvement from GPT-4 to GPT-5 is ‚Äúnot as large‚Äù as the one from GPT-3 to GPT-4. AI expert and often-skeptic Gary Marcus says: ‚ÄúFans will still find something to rejoice in, but GPT-5 is not the huge leap forward people long expected.‚Äù'}, {'id': '706e23d8-2866-48be-8421-4496dd1025f2', 'url': 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/', 'date': '3 hours ago', 'title': 'Sam Altman addresses ‚Äòbumpy‚Äô GPT-5 rollout, bringing 4o back, and the ‚Äòchart crime‚Äô', 'source': 'TechCrunch', 'content': 'During a Reddit ask-me-anything session on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and key members of the GPT-5 team were peppered with questions about the new model and requests to bring back its previous model, GPT-4o. They also asked Altman about the most embarrassing ‚Äî and perhaps funniest ‚Äî snafu in the presentation, the ‚Äúchart crime.‚Äù One of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out is a real-time router that decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to ‚Äúthink‚Äù through answers. But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn‚Äôt working as well for them as 4o did. Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed ‚Äúdumber‚Äù was the router wasn‚Äôt working properly when it was rolled out Thursday. ‚ÄúGPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,‚Äù Altman promised. Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. ‚ÄúWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,‚Äù he wrote. And Altman also promised, ‚ÄúWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.‚Äù This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.

According to OpenAI, GPT-5 was 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT-4o in tests in which it had web search enabled and used anonymized prompts; when ‚Äúthinking,‚Äù GPT-5 was 80% less likely to contain an error than OpenAI o3. But that still doesn‚Äôt eradicate hallucinations, and, as Mashable explains, it means that GPT-5 will still hallucinate one out of every 10 times on common tasks. A better writer According to OpenAI, GPT-5 is a much better writer than its predecessors, producing more ‚Äúcompelling, resonant writing with literary depth and rhythm.‚Äù The company provided side-by-side comparisons of GPT-5‚Äôs output versus that of GPT-4o for things like wedding toasts and poems. A better coder While previous versions of GPT had software coding capabilities, OpenAI says GPT-5 brings improved ease and sophistication to its ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù functionality, allowing users to ‚Äúcreate beautiful and responsive websites, apps, and games‚Äù in a single prompt. Agentic capabilities GPT-5 integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar to assist with scheduling, reminders, email follow‚Äëups, and other productivity tasks. (This capability will be initially limited to users of the company‚Äôs paid ‚Äúpro‚Äù membership.) Health LLMs have become a popular way for people to get medical information and health advice. OpenAI says GPT-5 scores higher than any of its previous models on the HealthBench test, and that it acts more like ‚Äúan active thought partner, proactively flagging potential concerns and asking questions to give more helpful answers.‚Äù Of course, OpenAI also points out that it does not replace a medical professional. Your mileage may vary Those are just a few of the new features and improvements, which will provide plenty of opportunity for consumers and businesses to experiment with the latest model and compare it with their current go-to models. Whether it represents a major leap forward, or more of an iterative improvement will become clear in the days and weeks ahead as outside experts test the model and real-world users play around with it. Early testers interviewed by Reuters said the improvement from GPT-4 to GPT-5 is ‚Äúnot as large‚Äù as the one from GPT-3 to GPT-4. AI expert and often-skeptic Gary Marcus says: ‚ÄúFans will still find something to rejoice in, but GPT-5 is not the huge leap forward people long expected.‚Äù'}, {'id': '706e23d8-2866-48be-8421-4496dd1025f2', 'url': 'https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/', 'date': '3 hours ago', 'title': 'Sam Altman addresses ‚Äòbumpy‚Äô GPT-5 rollout, bringing 4o back, and the ‚Äòchart crime‚Äô', 'source': 'TechCrunch', 'content': 'During a Reddit ask-me-anything session on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and key members of the GPT-5 team were peppered with questions about the new model and requests to bring back its previous model, GPT-4o. They also asked Altman about the most embarrassing ‚Äî and perhaps funniest ‚Äî snafu in the presentation, the ‚Äúchart crime.‚Äù One of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out is a real-time router that decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to ‚Äúthink‚Äù through answers. But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn‚Äôt working as well for them as 4o did. Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed ‚Äúdumber‚Äù was the router wasn‚Äôt working properly when it was rolled out Thursday. ‚ÄúGPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,‚Äù Altman promised. Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. ‚ÄúWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,‚Äù he wrote. And Altman also promised, ‚ÄúWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.‚Äù This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.

The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar. OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-5 ‚Äúchart crime.‚Äù Image Credits:OpenAI Altman didn‚Äôt answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a ‚Äúmega chart screwup‚Äù on X. Others noted the charts in the published blog post were correct. But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model‚Äôs performance, also pointed out that turning data into a table was ‚Äúgood example of a GPT-5 failure.‚Äù In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most. He ended the AMA with a promise: ‚ÄúWe will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.‚Äù'}], 'synthesis': 'OpenAI unveiled GPT-5 as its ‚Äúsmartest, fastest, most useful model yet,‚Äù introducing a real-time router that intelligently selects the best sub-model for each task, preset personalities for tailored interactions, and enhanced writing, coding, and health advice capabilities, according to [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/08/07/gpt-5-everything-new-different-hallucinations-personalities-vibecoding-agents-openai/). The company boasts a significant reduction in hallucinations‚ÄîGPT-5 is reportedly 45% less prone to factual errors than GPT-4o with web-enabled searching‚Äîthough it still can misinform one in ten times. Early testers suggest the leap from GPT-4 to GPT-5 is less dramatic than prior jumps, with AI skeptic Gary Marcus warning that ‚ÄúGPT-5 is not the huge leap forward people long expected.‚Äù \n\nHowever, the rollout has been "bumpy," as [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/) reports. Users complained GPT-5 appeared ‚Äúdumber‚Äù following launch because the new router malfunctioned, failing to pick the best model per query. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue, promising fixes that would make the model‚Äôs behavior more transparent and restoring rate limits to support user experimentation. Some Plus subscribers requested the return of GPT-4o, and OpenAI is reportedly considering letting them keep it due to tradeoff concerns. Compounding frustrations was the infamous ‚Äúchart crime‚Äù from the live presentation‚Äîan embarrassing visualization error that Altman termed a ‚Äúmega chart screwup,‚Äù though official blog charts remained accurate.\n\nThese contrasting narratives expose a tension between OpenAI‚Äôs ambitious marketing of GPT-5‚Äôs advances and the practical hiccups encountered during real-world deployment. OpenAI pushes GPT-5 as a major productivity enhancer with agentic features integrated across apps, but early skepticism and rollout glitches temper enthusiasm. The company‚Äôs transparency and responsiveness‚Äîcommitting to fixes and user choice‚Äîreflect an iterative approach amid high expectations and inevitable technical growing pains. Readers should weigh both the breakthroughs heralded by official sources like [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2025/08/07/gpt-5-everything-new-different-hallucinations-personalities-vibecoding-agents-openai/) and the lived user experience detailed by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/08/sam-altman-addresses-bumpy-gpt-5-rollout-bringing-4o-back-and-the-chart-crime/) to grasp GPT-5‚Äôs evolving reality.'}, 'refined_topic': 'GPT-5'}}] count=None

That meant some users found GPT-5 ‚Äúdumber‚Äù than the earlier GPT-4o, prompting Altman to apologize, promise better transparency, temporarily bring back GPT-4o for Plus users, and double API rate limits to smooth adoption. Plus, a confusing ‚Äúchart crime‚Äù from the launch slides didn‚Äôt help, fueling doubts about how polished this rollout really was.\n\nHere‚Äôs the headline: GPT-5 arrived under pressure, showing glitches and divided user reactions, but OpenAI‚Äôs quick transparency and fixes signal they‚Äôre learning in real time. The missing official details versus active community chatter reveal a rough balance between hype and reality.

In a Kentucky county, they‚Äôre using an AI tool called Sensemaker to listen better‚Äîbeyond loud town halls‚Äîto what people really think. By analyzing community opinions at scale, the platform helps reveal surprising agreements and makes local democracy more inclusive. It‚Äôs a great reminder that AI isn‚Äôt all doom and gloom; it can build bridges, not just break them.\n\nAnd then there‚Äôs Tesla, whose AI hype takes a hit: [Bloomberg‚Äôs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/tesla-disbands-dojo-supercomputer-team-in-blow-to-ai-effort) article‚Äîstill behind a paywall‚Äîreports Tesla is shutting down its Dojo supercomputer AI team. If true, it shows even the giants are struggling to keep pace with AI‚Äôs lightning changes, forcing tough course corrections. When you put these together, it‚Äôs clear AI‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt simple. It‚Äôs crime, community, and corporate chaos all unfolding simultaneously‚Äîreminding us that AI shapes our world in multiple, sometimes conflicting ways.', 'profiling': [], 'selection': [], 'synthesis': ''}}}] count=None
